# Reflection Questions

- What worked well in your process?
  - I think that one of the things that worked well for me was utilizing TDD. I started by writing my tests, and while I won't have access to the same environment everytime, it gave me a place to test out what I was working on. I'm also proud that I went through and talked through my process, asked clarifying questions, and solved the problem in two different ways.
- What was difficult/where did you struggle?
  - The place I struggled was with BigO notation and efficiency. I also didn't go through the process of testing out a million numbered array.
- What feedback/discussion did you have with your peer?
  - Tomorrow me
- Is there anything you want to change about your approach to the next technical challenge?
  - Being less afraid of Big O

## If this isnâ€™t your first technical challenge:

- Were you able to improve your approach? What went better?
  - I was able to remain more calm when things didn't work well and worked through a process in a more regimented manner instead of just thinking about all of the "what ifs"
