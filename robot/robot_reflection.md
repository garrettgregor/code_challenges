# Reflection Questions

- What worked well in your process?
  - I really enjoyed thinking through the problem with my group.
- What was difficult/where did you struggle?
  - It was really challenging to comprehend the problem first, and then to understand exactly how to build it was challenging too.
- What feedback/discussion did you have with your peer?
  - The feedback we had was mostly in real time, but the group said that I did a good job coming up with solutions and having a steady head.
- Is there anything you want to change about your approach to the next technical challenge?
  - I want to take more time assessing the questions.

## If this isnâ€™t your first technical challenge

- Were you able to improve your approach? What went better?
  - I was able to come up with solutions and break it down into smaller parts.
